This application was developed to help bridge 
engineers come up with an optimum prestressing 
beam arrangement based on the design data given 
in the Shay Murtagh catalogue. 

This application was developed by Peter Cox, 
an assistant bridge engineer at Mott Macdonald. 

Updates for this application can be downloaded 
at http://www.github.com/eurocodehelpers. 

Any feature requests and updates (including 
bugs) can be requested by contacting me at 
support@eurocodehelpers.com. 

It should go without saying, but this application 
is not endorsed by Shay Murtagh!
